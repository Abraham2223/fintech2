Intel
 cut its quarterly dividend by more than 65%, from 36.5 cents to 12.5 cents, the chipmaker announced Wednesday, weeks after the company implemented a wide-ranging set of cost cuts.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts that the company’s board was cautious in weighing the first dividend cut since 2000. He added Intel intended to resume growing the dividend “over time.”



Intel shares were largely flat at Wednesday’s open after the news.

Gelsinger insisted on the call that both he and the board remained committed to maintaining a competitive yield. Intel’s dividend yield is now 1.9%, based on Tuesday’s closing price, down significantly from its prior yield of 5.6%
